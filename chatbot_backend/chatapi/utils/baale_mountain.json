Together with the nearby state- and community-managed forests, it covers over 4,000 km². The road from the plateau descends the Harenna escarpment, leading into the dense forest. \n\nThe upper part of the Harenna Forest is a wet cloud forest, home to an extensive bamboo belt, especially in the steeper areas. On the road, you’ll also find Rubus steuderi, a plant from the blackberry family, which blooms from April to June. As you descend to around 2,200 meters, the terrain becomes gentler, and large trees—up to 30 meters tall—become more common. These trees include fern pines (Podocarpus gracilior) and fig trees (Ficus spp.), both of which are covered in dense epiphytes. Wild forest coffee (Arabica sp.) thrives in the lower parts of the forest. \n\nThe dense nature of the forest means that animals can easily remain hidden. Common species include the black-and-white colobus monkey, olive baboon, warthog, and Menelik’s bushbuck. With some luck, you might spot a giant forest hog, bush pig, or the endemic Bale monkey. The clearings in the forest are good places to look for larger predators such as lions, leopards, and African wild dogs. Nocturnal animals like genet, civet, porcupine, and hyena are also present. \n\nBirdlife in the Harenna Forest is equally elusive. Look out for the Abyssinian hill babbler, Abyssinian crimson-wing, Ayre’s hawk eagle, silvery-cheeked hornbill, black-winged lovebird, Abyssinian oriole, yellow-fronted parrot, white-cheeked turaco, and narina trogon. The forest is also home to many migrant bird species, including Palearctic warblers."

              "content": "The Northern Grasslands, also known as the Gaysay Grasslands, are located between the Web and Danka Rivers, south of Bodeti Mountain, north of Adelay Ridge, and northwest of Dinsho. The altitude in this area ranges from 3,000 meters to 3,500 meters, which marks the upper limit for tree growth. The terrain is mostly flat, covered by swamp grasses and sedges, particularly from the Cyperus and Scirpus genera. During the rainy season, the land becomes muddy.\n\nIn higher areas, the vegetation consists of scrubby plants, including African or wild wormwood (Artemisia afra) and Cape gold (Helichrysum splendidum), which is one of over ten species of everlasting flowers found in the park. These plants are crucial for both food and shelter for the mountain nyala and other wildlife. Hagenia abyssinica trees bloom from November to February, with female trees showing vibrant red flowers. Wild fennel is also common in this area.\n\nThe Northern Grasslands are an ideal location for observing the endemic mountain nyala, with herds sometimes reaching up to 50 individuals. The bohor reedbuck is also frequently seen here and plays a key role in the ecosystem as the primary grazer in this region. Other mammals commonly found include warthogs, grey duikers, servals, golden jackals, and spotted hyenas (particularly at night).\n\nBird species that can be spotted in the Northern Grasslands include the Abyssinian longclaw, winding cisticola, marsh harrier, Abyssinian ground hornbill, spot-breasted plover, Rouget’s rail, wattled ibis, and Abyssinian catbird, among others."
